- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It simplifies a lot of repeated parts of different but similar objects and makes the program organized. It's a lot easier to keep track of a long list of attributes. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was a bit confusing to account for expections in the library methods. The class notes and demos were very helpful.
